title: RISCV processor
description: RV32I RISCV processor written in VHDL, with a C toolchain
---

My biggest project during my S8 was the implementation of a RV32I RISCV processor on a Nexys A7 FPGA board. I was in a team of six students, and my job was to create test binaries in order to validate each instruction. When the processor was done, I had to set the gcc toolchain to work on our processor.
