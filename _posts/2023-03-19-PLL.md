A PLL is an electronic circuit that can be used to generate an output signal that is synchronizedin frequency and phase with an input signal.
The main function of a PLL is to track and synchronize the frequency and phase of a reference signal with an output signal.

Phase Detector
==============

The phase detector receives in input two signals $v1(t)$ and $v2(t)$ and returns a signal $v(t)=K.f(\phi_{ref}-\phi_{osc})$
