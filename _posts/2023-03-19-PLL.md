title: "Phase-locked Loops"
---


A PLL is an electronic circuit that can be used to generate an output signal that is synchronized in frequency and phase with an input signal.
The main function of a PLL is to track and synchronize the frequency and phase of a reference signal with an output signal.

Phase Detector
==============

The phase detector receives in input two signals $v1(t)$ and $v2(t)$ and returns a signal $v(t)=K_d.f(\Phi_{ref}-\Phi_{osc})$.

Usual phase detectors are the Balanced Mixer(for sinusoid signals) or XOR comparator(for digital signals).

Low-pass filter
===============

The main objective of the low-pass filter is to generate the voltage used for the VCO.
Usually, the transfer function is $F(p)=\frac{1}{1+\tau P}$ with $\tau = RC$ for a RC filter.

VCO
===

The VCO aims to generate the output signal. The output signal is linear around its working pulsation.
Indeed, $\omega_{VCO} = \omega_{1} + K_0(U_{VCO} - U_1)$, with $K_0$ the gain of the VCO.

Reminder
====

Useful functions and values:

*Transfert function of a linearized PLL :
$$H(p)=\frac{K_d K_0 F(p)}{p + K_d K_0 F(p)} = \frac{\omega _n$$
