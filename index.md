### About me:

I am a 21 years old engineering student at Bordeaux's [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://www.bordeaux-inp.fr/en){:target="_blank"}. I study analogue and digital electronics, signal processing and automation. My best liked subjects are FPGA programming and microelectronics. I am currently looking for a 3 months internship in Europe during this summer. If everything goes fine, I will be graduated in 2024.

I intend to use this website as a portfolio (see my [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/)), but also as a [blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/). I will publish articles about what I study in practical work. This should help my understanding of the subjects.
